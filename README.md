Version: <br>
0.0.0 - Fox sprite animation complete <br>
0.0.1 - Foxy can now jump via space bar! <br>
0.0.2 - collision detection between fox and obstacle works. Delta time added to obstacle movement<br>
0.0.21 - made obstacles's bb always on so can toggle foxy's bb visibilty for testing<br>
0.0.3 - refactored for proper pixel-sized scaling<br>
0.1.0 - obstacle sprites added<br>

Todo:<br>
Foxy state machine to handle animation states<br>
add offsets to obstacles, shortlist the ones I want to use<br>
make custom collision shapes for each final obstacle<br>
increasing game speed (50-80 seems to be a good range)<br>
add clouds that will drift across sky<br>
